# CLAUDE.md — Root Instructions for Claude Code

This is the **root** instruction file. It covers project-wide rules. Claude Code reads nested `CLAUDE.md` files automatically when working inside subdirectories — refer to those for component-specific rules.

| When working on... | Read this |
|---|---|
| Backend API, indexer, monitor, takedown, audit | [`backend/CLAUDE.md`](./backend/CLAUDE.md) |
| Web crawler, spiders, proxy handling | [`crawler/CLAUDE.md`](./crawler/CLAUDE.md) |
| Face detection, liveness, embeddings, clustering | [`ml/CLAUDE.md`](./ml/CLAUDE.md) |
| Public site, admin panel (Jinja2 + HTMX) | [`frontend/CLAUDE.md`](./frontend/CLAUDE.md) |

## Project Summary

**FaceGuard** finds where users' faces appear across the public internet, so they can request takedowns. Two web surfaces: a public site for end users and an admin panel for moderation.

Critically, this is a **biometric data product** in a high-abuse-potential category. Liveness checks at enrollment and search are non-negotiable safety features, not optional polish.

Project is in **early design phase** — no production code exists yet. Prefer clean structure over quick hacks.

**The developer is a beginner in frontend, knows FastAPI on the backend.** Pick simple, Python-first solutions wherever possible.

---

## Top-Level Architecture Principles

1. **Modular by component**: backend, crawler, ml, frontend are separate services that communicate via APIs and message queues
2. **Queue-driven**: components don't call each other directly — they emit and consume events (Celery+Redis to start, Kafka when scaling)
3. **Stateless inference**: ML workers are horizontally scalable, never hold per-user state
4. **Idempotent ingestion**: re-processing the same image must not create duplicate index entries (dedupe by content hash)
5. **Fail loudly**: explicit errors over silent failures, especially in inference and takedown flows
6. **Audit everything biometric**: every face read, write, search, or delete writes to the audit log
7. **Python-first**: keep the stack Python wherever possible. The only non-Python code in the project is ~50 lines of vanilla JavaScript for webcam capture.

**Important**: `frontend/` is misleadingly named — it's actually two full Python web apps that render server-side HTML. Not a JS/TS project.

## Cross-Cutting Standards

### Python (all components)
- Python **3.11+** only
- **Type hints everywhere** — no untyped functions
- **`uv`** for dependency management
- Format with **`ruff format`**, lint with **`ruff check`**
- **`pytest`** for tests; target >80% coverage on core logic
- Async for IO-bound (FastAPI handlers, HTTP, DB); sync for CPU-bound (inference)
- **SQLModel** for ORM (Pydantic-native, FastAPI-friendly)

### HTML / Templates (frontend)
- Jinja2 with autoescape enabled
- HTMX for interactivity (no SPAs, no React)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN; DaisyUI for components
- Only place JavaScript is used: webcam capture (~50 lines, lives in `frontend/shared/static/js/webcam.js`)

### Git
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Branch naming: `feat/<short-name>`, `fix/<short-name>`
- Squash merge to `main`; require PR approval

### Secrets
- **Never** hardcode secrets — use `.env` locally, secrets manager in production
- **Never** commit `.env`, only `.env.example`

## Environment Variables (shared)

Defined in root `.env.example`. Each component reads what it needs.

## Legal & Compliance (Project-Wide)

Biometric data is **GDPR Article 9 special category data**. Treat it accordingly:

- **Lawful basis**: explicit consent, captured at enrollment with timestamped record
- **Liveness at enrollment**: prevents non-consensual enrollment
- **Liveness at search**: prevents stalking use case
- **Audit log**: every biometric operation logged with actor, target, action, timestamp
- **Right to erasure**: complete deletion within 30 days, including index entries
- **Right to portability**: data export endpoint must return all PII + embeddings
- **Robots.txt**: respected by crawler unless explicit override with documented justification in `docs/legal/crawl-overrides.md`
- **Annotate compliance-relevant code** with comment markers:
  - `# GDPR:` for data subject rights logic
  - `# AI-ACT:` for AI Act conformity logic
  - `# AUDIT:` for code that must write to audit log
  - `# LEGAL:` for crawler ethics logic

A legal review is required before production launch.

---

## What NOT to Do (Project-Wide)

- ❌ Do **not** store raw face crops in the vector DB — embeddings only
- ❌ Do **not** bypass the queue and call the indexer directly from another service
- ❌ Do **not** skip liveness checks on enrollment or search endpoints
- ❌ Do **not** add a new endpoint without rate limiting
- ❌ Do **not** log raw biometric data anywhere
- ❌ Do **not** commit `.env` or any file with real credentials
- ❌ Do **not** modify the audit log writer to make it optional — every biometric op must log
- ❌ Do **not** introduce React, Vue, or any SPA framework without an ADR — the project is Python-first by design

---

## ADR Process

Any significant technical decision (vector DB choice, model architecture, queue system, etc.) gets an ADR in `docs/adr/`:

```
docs/adr/
├── 001-vector-db-choice.md
├── 002-liveness-passive-vs-active.md
├── 003-embedding-model-selection.md
├── 004-htmx-vs-spa.md
└── ...
```

Template:
```markdown
# ADR-NNN: <Title>

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** <names>

## Context
Why does this decision need to be made?

## Options Considered
1. Option A — pros/cons
2. Option B — pros/cons
3. Option C — pros/cons

## Decision
What did we decide and why?

## Consequences
What are the trade-offs? What becomes easier? Harder?

## References

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Full stack up
docker compose up

# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Format & lint everything
uv run ruff format . && uv run ruff check .

# Run individual services in dev
uv run uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload --port 8002
uv run uvicorn frontend.public-site.main:app --reload --port 8000
uv run uvicorn frontend.admin-panel.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

---

## Where to ask "should I?" before doing

Some decisions need human input before Claude Code should proceed unilaterally:

- Adding a new third-party data dependency (new crawler source, new commercial API)
- Changing the embedding model (requires full re-embedding)
- Adding a new biometric category (e.g. iris, voice)
- Anything affecting consent, retention, or audit logging
- Anything in `docs/legal/`
- Introducing JavaScript outside `frontend/shared/static/js/webcam.js`
- Introducing a SPA framework (React/Vue/etc.) — this goes against the project's Python-first principle

For these, propose an ADR and wait for sign-off.

## Beginner Notes

The developer building this is learning. When generating code:

- **Prefer clarity over cleverness.** Verbose-but-obvious beats compact-but-magical.
- **Add comments** explaining *why*, not *what* (the code already shows the what).
- **Suggest the simplest working solution first**, then mention more advanced options as future improvements.
- **Use the standard library** when it's good enough. Don't pull in a dependency for things that take 5 lines of plain Python.
- **Link to docs** when introducing a new concept. Library docs > tutorials > random blog posts.
- **Don't optimize prematurely.** Working > fast > scalable, in that order.

A `docs/learnings/` folder exists for the developer to record what they've learned. Encourage that habit when helpful.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- ALWAYS read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md before reading any source files, running grep/glob searches, or answering codebase questions. The graph is your primary map of the codebase.
- IF graphify-out/wiki/index.md EXISTS, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
